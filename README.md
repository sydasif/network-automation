# Network Automation
--------------------

What is Network Automation?

Network automation is the process of automating the configuration, management and operations of a computer network. The tasks that were normally done by the network or system administrator can be automated using a number of tools and technologies. 

Scripting languages are widely used by Network and System administrators for automating the tasks. This saves time, effort and thereby reducing human errors as well. Among the automation tools, Python and Ansible are the most popular ones. With Software Defined Networking (SDN) in picture, knowing any of these programming languages is vital for the future of administering the network and systems.

## Setting up the Lab

### Softwareâ€™s and images used

Item                     | Software
------------------------ | --------
Lab simulation software  | GNS3
Switches | Cisco L2 virtual
Network Automation PC | Docker in GNS3

### Topology
In this lab topology, I have used the following components in GNS3.
1. A Network Automation Appliance. We will be coding python in this PC.
2. A Layer2 Ethernet Switch.
3. A NAT cloud, this is used to provide internet connectivity and also acts as a DHCP server.
4. Three Cisco Virtual IOS switches.
5. [Device Configuration](https://github.com/sydasif/network-automation/tree/master/configuration)
